A code showcase by Mick Soudant
============

An indication of what i'm currently capable off. 

## Current showcase items

### 1. menu-resize
A minor project using npm, gulp and sass to create a simple but clean navigation resize with animation.

### 2. advanced programming minor assignments
Assignments i made during my minor advanced programming to solve "complex" problems using "advanced" algorithms.

## Upcoming showcase items

### 3. A minor REST Api build in CakePHP
Building this for the sake of learning and improving my skillset. Also for use in combination with the angular 6 project.

### 4. CRUD Frontend made in angular 6
I worked with angular 4 during my last ionic project. So to "update my knowledge" i decided to start a minor angular 6 project to interact with the CakePHP REST api.
