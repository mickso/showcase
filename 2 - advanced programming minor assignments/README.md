Advanced programming minor assignments
============

For my minor on the HAN(Hoge school van Arnhem en Nijmegen), i chose advanced programming. 

During this minor we had to implement multiple existing algorithms to solve a set of scenario's.

## 1. Partion
Given a positive integer n, generate all possible unique ways to represent n as sum of positive integers. 

## 2. Binary tree (Twothreetree)
Build a binary tree using a chosen algorith, in this case i chose the "twothreetree" construct.
  
## 3. Brute force (Breadth first path)
Brute force solving a maze using the breadth first path algorithm.

## 4. Greedy algorithm (Traveling salesman)
Using dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to solve the traveling salesman case. (Find an optimal route to travel between all the cities)

## 5. Backtracking (N Queens)
Use a backtracking algorithm to place 8 queens on a chessboard while no two queens threaten eachother.

## 6. Hillclimbing
Generate an elevated map and try to find the highest point on the map.

## 7. Anagram
Find all anagrams in a given sentence.

## 8. Changedispenser
Create a function that can split a money sum into coints for multiple currencies(Euro's and Guldens).
